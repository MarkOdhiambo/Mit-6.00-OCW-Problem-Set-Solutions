These are my problem set solutions for MIT's OpenCourseWare 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming as taught in: Fall 2008.

I posted them to GitHub as a way for me to practice using git and to make these solutions available to other students work on 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science.

Note that the problem sets and solutions are unique to each semester of the 6.00 class.  I.e., the problem set for Fall 2008 are not the same as for Fall 2010.

The full course, including videos and transcripts of lectures, reading assignments, problem sets, and quizes can be found at:
